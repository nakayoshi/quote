> Quote allows you to quote messages in a better way


### **[ðŸŽ« Invite to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=678185722473349120&scope=bot&permissions=536964096)**

## Usage

## Required Permissions

## How it works

Quote uses Discord's Webhook API to send messages with a customised username and an avatar. We delete the original message and use this technique to pretend the message as if it was sent by another user.

## FAQ

### Quote didn't find the message despite I used the command properly

Due to Discord's API limitation, the number of messages you can go back is restricted up to 100. Alternatively, we provide another way that uses URL to quote so you can use it to avoid the issue.

### Quote doesn't work on my server! What's wrong?
There's several possible scenarios. Check the following cases:

#### Permisson is not enough
See *Required Permissions* section above and give enough permissions for running Quote.

#### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) must be disabled.
Since Quote using some admin-level features such as "Manage Messages", you need to disable 2FA otherwise it will not work properly.

### Why my message has a badge _BOT_?

Since Quote uses Discord's Webhook API to replace your message, the embed was actually sent by the bot though it is pretended as if you sent it.

### This is an awesome idea! Why doesn't the Discord team implement it officially?

I don't know Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ Tell them to hire me.
